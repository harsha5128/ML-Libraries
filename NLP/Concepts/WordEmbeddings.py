# ðŸ”¹ Sample Financial Sentences
sentences = [

    ["Bitcoin", "surpassed", "60000", "amid", "market", "fluctuations"],
    ["Federal", "Reserve", "announced", "interest", "rate", "hike"]

# ðŸ”¹ Train a Word2Vec Model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

# ðŸ”¹ Get Word Embeddings

"""
- `vector_size=100`: Each word is represented as a **100-dimensional vector**.
- `window=5`: Looks at **5 words before and after** a target word for context.
- `min_count=1`: Includes words appearing at least **once** in the corpus.
- `workers=4`: Uses **4 CPU cores** for parallel training.

# ðŸ“Œ SUMMARY
# =====================================================
"""
âœ… Why Word Embeddings?
- Captures **semantic meaning** of financial terms.
- Helps in **market sentiment analysis & fraud detection**.

âœ… Where is it used?
- **Stock price prediction**: Analyzes past financial news.
- **Customer risk profiling**: Identifies risky behavior in financial transactions.

âœ… Advantages & Disadvantages:
| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Preserves word relationships       | Needs a **large dataset**         |
| Captures semantic meaning          | Doesn't handle **out-of-vocab words** |

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices:
- Use **pre-trained embeddings** like **GloVe or FastText** for better financial term recognition.
- Fine-tune on **financial documents** (SEC filings, earnings reports) for better accuracy.
